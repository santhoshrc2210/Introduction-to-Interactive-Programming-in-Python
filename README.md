# Mini_Projects_Python
Codes are part of a course that I took on Coursera-Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python by Rice University.
Starter code was given to students and with the help of "hints" provided by instructors mini projects were completed by me.
Since I am only a novice this is not the most elegant code.

Copy paste the code in codeskulptor or visit the link given in the code and click run. Turn off pop-up blockers.
